Hello! I'm Baruch Rutman, also known as my internet nickname Peterooch.  
I'm a Software Engineering student at Sami Shamoon College of Engineering in the lovely city of Be'er Sheva in Israel.  
Previously I was hobbyist programmer that still likes to program things just to solve problems I encounter in my daily life.  
  
Programming since 2009 starting with toying with JavaScript.   
Open source contributor since 2013, mainly contributing to ReactOS.  
Also contributed in a smaller scale to Microsoft Winfile, Wine, UniExtract2.  
Started studying Software Engineering in the spring of 2019.  
Currently in a break between second and third year.  

I know to program things in the following languages and technologies (in order of experience/comfort):  
- C / C++ with additional experience in Win32 API  
- C# and MVC.NET Core (with EF Core)  
- Python with pandas, sklearn and other data oriented libraries  
- JavaScript (and some little amounts of JQuery)  
- Java  
  
Currently looking for a student position in the field, do contact me if you think I'll fit your team/company.  
  
Other tidbits:  
I know to design basic things in HTML, CSS and Bootstrap.  
I use Visual Studio Code for everything because why not. (I'm looking at you JetBrains)  
  
Current goals programming wise are to make RTL mirroring to work in ReactOS.  

Learned while working on BiDi and Mirroring support how Windows does some of those things even though
 I'm using Wine as reference of functioning implementation.
