<p></p>1. Added separate strings for having "file" and "files" statuses to make localization easier
<br/>2. Moved String tables from res.rc to winfile.dlg and renamed it "lang\en-US.rc" (PR <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/winfile/pull/101">#101</a> microsoft/winfile)
<br/>3. Added RTL mirroring code, and reversed bitmap resources as a "quick and dirty" fix for flipped buttons
<br/>4. Changed some parameter definitions in certain function calls to
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;make 2 and 3 a posibility (heavy use of the trenary operator)
<br/>5. Added in progress hebrew translation
