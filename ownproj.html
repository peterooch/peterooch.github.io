    A C# program that works like a procedural script that makes this <a href="http://www.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/UnicodeData.txt">file</a>
    into <a href="https://github.com/reactos/reactos/blob/ef4075bbc44098efeea40551cc76286f91a68c34/reactos/dll/win32/getuname/lang/en-US.rc">this.</a> (it got since then a bit different...)
    <br/><br/><span class="minih"><a href="https://github.com/peterooch/myutils/blob/master/unigen/getuname_test.cpp">getuname_test.cpp</a></span>
    <br/>A small program that is related to the above.<br/><br/>
    <span class="minih"><a href="https://github.com/peterooch/textreverser">TextReverser</a></span><br/>
    First program that I ever made... with an overly complicated main algorithm to boot!<br/>
    <br/>
    There's more stuff in <a href="https://github.com/peterooch/">here</a>, but it's mostly conceptual non functioning code and long abandoned forks.
